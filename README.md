# Particle_Swarm_Optimization

This project finds the global minimum of the Mccormick Function using a swarm intelligence approach. In particle file, individual properties of a particle in swarm are specified. In PSO_swarm, methods such as finding the best global value and position of the swarm, updating individual particle's velocity are implemented, and pso_main constructs a swarm using a size specified by the reader and runs the swarm for iterations specified by the reader. The program also implements a visualization to let the users gain a sense of how swarm evolves.
